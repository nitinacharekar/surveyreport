    "Malaysia": "Based on the provided demographic and statistical data for Malaysia, we can derive a detailed analysis of API security trends, strengths, weaknesses, and unique characteristics specific to this country. \n\n### API Security Trends in Malaysia\n\n1. **Importance of API Security**:\n   - A significant percentage of organizations in Malaysia recognize the importance of API security in the next 12 months. This reflects a growing awareness of API vulnerabilities and the need for robust security measures. It is noteworthy that organizations in Malaysia may prioritize API security more than their counterparts in regions with less digital transformation.\n\n2. **Maturity of API Security Capabilities**:\n   - The maturity of API security capabilities among Malaysian organizations is a critical factor. If a high percentage of respondents indicate low maturity levels, it suggests that many organizations are still in the early stages of developing their API security strategies. This could be a unique characteristic compared to more developed markets where organizations may have more advanced capabilities.\n\n3. **Responsibility for API Security**:\n   - The distribution of responsibility for API security within organizations can reveal insights into organizational structure and prioritization. If a notable percentage of organizations assign responsibility to non-technical roles, it may indicate a lack of understanding of API security's technical complexities, which could be a weakness.\n\n4. **Investment in API Security**:\n   - Expectations regarding changes in API security investment can highlight trends in organizational commitment to improving security measures. If a majority of organizations plan to increase their investment, it indicates a proactive approach to addressing security"
