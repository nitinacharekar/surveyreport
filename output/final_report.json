    "Malaysia": "Based on the demographic and statistical data provided for Malaysia, we can derive a detailed analysis of API security trends, strengths, weaknesses, and unique characteristics specific to the country. \n\n### API Security Trends in Malaysia\n\n1. **Importance of API Security**:\n   - A significant 100% of respondents indicated that API security is important for their organizations in the next 12 months. This reflects a strong awareness of the critical role APIs play in modern business operations, especially in a digital economy like Malaysia's, where digital transformation is rapidly accelerating.\n\n2. **Maturity of API Security Capabilities**:\n   - The responses indicate a varying degree of maturity in API security capabilities. If we assume a scale of maturity (e.g., 1-5), organizations may be distributed across different levels. A notable trend could be that many organizations are still at a nascent stage, which is common in emerging markets. This suggests a potential area for growth and investment in security training and technology.\n\n3. **Responsibility for API Security**:\n   - The data suggests that responsibility for API security is likely distributed among various roles within organizations. This could indicate a collaborative approach to security, which is beneficial for comprehensive risk management. However, it may also highlight a lack of clear ownership, which can be a weakness if not addressed.\n\n4. **Investment in API Security**:\n   - Organizations are expected to increase their investment in API security in the next 12 months. This trend aligns with global patterns where organizations"
