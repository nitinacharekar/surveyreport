This reflects a growing awareness of cybersecurity threats and the critical role APIs play in digital transformation.\n\n2. **Maturity of API Security Capabilities**: The maturity level of API security capabilities among Malaysian organizations is a key area of focus. While specific maturity levels are not detailed in the data, organizations that report higher maturity levels often have more robust security frameworks in place, indicating a proactive approach to API security.\n\n3. **Responsibility for API Security**: The distribution of responsibility for API security within organizations can reveal unique organizational structures. For instance, if a majority of organizations indicate that the responsibility lies with IT security teams rather than development teams, this could suggest a more centralized approach to security, which may differ from countries where development teams take a more active role.\n\n4. **Investment Trends**: The expectation for changes in API security investment over the next year is a critical indicator of organizational priorities. If a significant portion of organizations plan to increase their investment, it suggests a recognition of the evolving threat landscape and a commitment to enhancing security measures.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- **Proactive Investment"
