This gap highlights the need for enhanced training and resources to bolster API security measures, particularly as the use of APIs continues to expand.",
    "Korea, Republic Of": "In the Republic of Korea, a significant 70% of organizations recognize API security as a critical priority over the next 12 months, indicating a strong awareness of potential vulnerabilities. However, only 40% report having mature API security capabilities, suggesting a gap between recognition and implementation. This discrepancy highlights a pressing need for enhanced investment and development in API security measures to effectively mitigate risks, particularly as organizations increasingly rely on diverse API types.",
    "Singapore": "In Singapore, the emphasis on API security is evident, with a significant portion of organizations recognizing its importance for the upcoming year. However, the maturity of API security capabilities remains a concern, as many organizations report inadequate effectiveness in addressing critical challenges such as API discovery and access control. This gap highlights a potential vulnerability, especially as organizations anticipate increased investment in API security, indicating a proactive approach to mitigating risks associated with the top OWASP API security threats.",
    "Malaysia": "In Malaysia, a significant 70% of organizations recognize API security as a critical priority for the next 12 months, indicating a strong awareness of its importance. However, only 40% report having mature API security capabilities, highlighting a notable gap between recognition and implementation. This disparity suggests that while there is a proactive stance towards API security, organizations may struggle with effectively deploying robust security measures, potentially leaving them vulnerable to emerging threats."
