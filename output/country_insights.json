  "ANZ": "In ANZ, there is a strong recognition of the importance of API security, with a significant number of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, despite this awareness, many organizations report low maturity levels in their API security capabilities, highlighting a concerning gap between recognition and implementation. This discrepancy suggests that while there is a proactive stance towards API security, effective measures and solutions may still be lacking, potentially exposing organizations to significant risks.",
  "India": "In India, a significant emphasis on API security is evident, with 100% of organizations indicating its importance over the next 12 months. However, there appears to be a maturity gap, as many organizations report low effectiveness in addressing key API security challenges, such as access control and runtime protection, suggesting a need for enhanced investment and development in these areas. Notably, the prevalence of concerns regarding regulatory compliance indicates that organizations may struggle to align their API security practices with evolving legal requirements, which could expose them to greater risks.",
  "China": "In China, there is a growing recognition of the importance of API security, with a significant number of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, a notable weakness lies in the maturity of API security capabilities, as many organizations report concerns about various security aspects, including access control and runtime protection challenges. This suggests a critical need for enhanced security measures and solutions to address vulnerabilities, particularly as the use of APIs continues to expand across sectors.",
  "Taiwan": "In Taiwan, there is a growing recognition of the importance of API security, with a significant number of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, many respondents report low maturity levels in their API security capabilities, suggesting a potential vulnerability as they scale their API usage. This disconnect highlights a critical need for enhanced training and resources to effectively address the top OWASP API security risks, which are a primary concern for the majority of organizations surveyed.",
  "Japan": "In Japan, there is a growing recognition of the importance of API security, with a significant number of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, a notable weakness lies in the maturity of API security capabilities, as many organizations still struggle with effective solutions for API discovery and access control challenges. This gap highlights a critical area for improvement, especially as the usage of APIs continues to expand, necessitating robust security measures to mitigate risks associated with the OWASP top API security threats.",
  "Indonesia": "In Indonesia, there is a significant recognition of the importance of API security, with a notable percentage of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, many organizations report low maturity levels in their API security capabilities, suggesting a gap between awareness and implementation. This discrepancy highlights a critical weakness in the current API security landscape, as organizations may struggle to effectively mitigate risks associated with the top OWASP API security threats they are concerned about.",
  "Korea, Republic Of": "In Korea, Republic Of, there is a strong recognition of the importance of API security, with 100% of respondents indicating it will be a priority for their organizations in the next 12 months. However, a notable weakness is reflected in the maturity of API security capabilities, as many organizations report low effectiveness in addressing critical challenges such as API Discovery and Access Control. This suggests a pressing need for enhanced investment and development in API security measures to mitigate risks associated with the top OWASP API security threats identified by a significant portion of the respondents.",
  "Singapore": "In Singapore, there is a notable emphasis on API security, with 100% of organizations recognizing its importance over the next 12 months, indicating a strong awareness of potential risks. However, maturity levels in API security capabilities remain a concern, as many organizations report challenges in addressing API discovery and access control, suggesting a gap between recognition and effective implementation. Additionally, with a significant portion of respondents indicating a need for improved solutions, there is an opportunity for growth in security investments and capabilities in the coming year.",
  "Malaysia": "In Malaysia, the emphasis on API security is notably high, with a significant portion of organizations recognizing its importance for the upcoming year. However, there appears to be a maturity gap in API security capabilities, as many organizations report concerns over various aspects of API security, including access control and runtime protection challenges. This suggests that while the awareness and investment in API security are increasing, organizations may struggle to implement effective solutions, highlighting a critical area for improvement in the Malaysian tech landscape."
