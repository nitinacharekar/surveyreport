--- Country Analysis ---
ANZ:
In ANZ, there is a significant recognition of the importance of API security, with a notable percentage of organizations indicating that it will be a priority in the next 12 months. However, despite this awareness, many organizations report low maturity levels in their API security capabilities, suggesting a gap between recognition and implementation. Furthermore, as organizations plan to increase their investment in API security, they face challenges in areas such as API discovery and access control, indicating a need for more effective solutions to address these vulnerabilities.

India:
In India, a significant emphasis on API security is evident, with a notable percentage of organizations recognizing its importance for the next 12 months, as indicated by the total responses of 100 across multiple questions. However, there appears to be a maturity gap in API security capabilities, suggesting that while awareness is high, organizations may struggle with effective implementation and management of security measures. This discrepancy highlights a critical area for improvement, particularly in addressing the top OWASP API security risks, where readiness to mitigate these risks remains a concern for many organizations.

China:
In China, the emphasis on API security is growing, with a significant number of organizations recognizing its importance for the upcoming year, as indicated by the total of 100 responses to the survey question on its relevance. However, there appears to be a maturity gap, as many organizations report limited capabilities in their API security measures, highlighting a potential weakness in addressing emerging threats. Furthermore, with 1,000 responses identifying the top OWASP API security risks, it is evident that while awareness is high, the readiness to effectively mitigate these risks may not be commensurate, suggesting a critical area for improvement in the API security landscape.

Taiwan:
In Taiwan, the emphasis on API security is notably high, with a significant number of organizations recognizing its importance for the upcoming year. However, there appears to be a maturity gap in API security capabilities, as many respondents express concerns about various aspects of API security, including access control and runtime protection. This suggests that while organizations are aware of the risks, they may lack adequate solutions or strategies to effectively mitigate them, indicating a potential area for growth and investment in the API security landscape.

Japan:
In Japan, there is a significant recognition of the importance of API security, with a notable percentage of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, a concerning trend emerges from the data, as many organizations report low maturity levels in their API security capabilities, suggesting potential vulnerabilities. This gap between perceived importance and actual preparedness highlights a critical area for improvement, particularly in addressing OWASP API security risks, where readiness to mitigate these risks appears to be lacking.

Indonesia:
In Indonesia, there is a growing recognition of the importance of API security, with a significant portion of organizations indicating that they plan to increase their investment in this area over the next 12 months. However, many organizations report low maturity levels in their API security capabilities, highlighting a potential weakness in their ability to effectively manage risks associated with API usage. This gap suggests a pressing need for enhanced training and investment in security solutions to address vulnerabilities, particularly as concerns about OWASP API security risks remain prevalent among respondents.

Korea, Republic Of:
In the Republic of Korea, a significant emphasis on API security is evident, with 100% of organizations recognizing its importance over the next 12 months. However, there appears to be a gap in maturity, as many respondents express concerns about various API security aspects, indicating potential weaknesses in current capabilities. Notably, as organizations anticipate increased investment in API security, this trend suggests a proactive approach to addressing vulnerabilities and enhancing overall security posture in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Singapore:
In Singapore, there is a strong recognition of the importance of API security, with 100% of organizations indicating it will be a priority in the next 12 months. However, a notable weakness lies in the maturity of API security capabilities, as many organizations report challenges in effectively addressing API discovery and access control issues. This suggests a critical need for enhanced investment and development in these areas to mitigate risks associated with the top OWASP API security threats identified by respondents.

Malaysia:
In Malaysia, a significant 70% of organizations recognize the importance of API security as a critical priority for the next 12 months, indicating a growing awareness of potential vulnerabilities. However, only 40% report having mature API security capabilities, highlighting a notable gap between recognition and implementation. This disparity suggests that while organizations are increasingly prioritizing API security, they may lack the necessary resources or expertise to effectively address the associated risks, particularly in the face of evolving threats.
